# react_button

Hello and welcome to my button application! This app was built for the sole purpose of helping me understand useEffect() Hook in React. useEffect is Hook
that takes the current state of an object and update it without sending a request and having to reload the page. In this app I was able to change the text
in the button by just simply clicking it without having to re-render the entire page thanks to the useEffect Hook.
